        <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
          <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend 
              the 
              University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program 
              known 
              as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
          <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more 
              money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping 
              starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. 
              "All of this left scars on me."   </li>
          <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job 
              in 
              the US Forestry Service
          <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret 
              Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin 
              Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, 
              who 
              teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
          <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after 
              the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the 
              military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to 
              control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
          <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and 
              Plant 
              Pathology
          <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from 
              Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico 
              to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 
              years, 
              his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent 
              wheat - including different varieties for each major climate 
              on Earth.
          <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice 
              each season, doubling wheat yields
          <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed 
              of 
              wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain 
              that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% 
              of 
              Mexico's wheat.
          <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high- 
              yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time 
              to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding 
              population
          <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize
          <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries 
              dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields
          <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at 
              Texas A&M University
          <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the 
              world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified 
              crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out 
              of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently 
              dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants 
              and animals for a long time. Long before we called it 
              science, people were selecting the best breeds."
          <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.
